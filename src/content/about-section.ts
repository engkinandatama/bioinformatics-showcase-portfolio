      "I began my journey in the world of science as a Biology graduate, developing a solid foundation in genetics, molecular biology, and biotechnology. During my academic years, I was introduced to the exciting intersection between biology and technology‚Äîparticularly through a course project involving protein-ligand docking using R. That moment sparked a deeper curiosity about computational biology and how data and code could help solve complex biological problems.",
      "As my interests evolved, I found myself drawn to the broader realm of technology. I started exploring beyond the lab‚Äîdelving into cloud computing, IoT, and DevOps through self-directed learning and hands-on experimentation. I became fascinated by how automation and data pipelines could streamline processes and bring biological research into the digital age.",
      "Today, I'm actively building a cross-disciplinary skillset at the intersection of biology and tech. Whether it's understanding the basics of infrastructure as code or experimenting with real-time IoT sensors, I'm driven by a passion to learn and contribute to innovation. I'm currently open to entry-level roles or internships where I can bring my unique background and continue growing in fields like technology, data science, or computational biology.",
